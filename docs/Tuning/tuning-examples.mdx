# Tuning examples and presets

:::caution
  Please use the supplied defaults until a maiden flight has been conducted and the filtering is confirmed. Once this is done higher gains can be tested. Skipping this step and using these settings without adequate filtering could result in an uncontrollable helicopter.

    Hey there! As the creator of the OMPHOBBY M7 and avid Rotorflight 2 user, I want to share my personal Rotorflight 2 tune for my models with you. This is a highly tuned 3D setup for the M7, featuring great stability, excellent setpoint tracking and very precise and locked-in response. Be aware that this setup is specifically tuned for my chosen components, and that it might not perform optimally if you fly different components. You can, however, use it as a baseline for your own tune. As always, first verify that your filters are working correctly, then proceed onto the PIDFOB numbers.  

    This tune is set up to work with a universal transmitter profile. Channel order is AECR1T23.  
    Ensure all channels reach ±100% travel!  
    AUX1 for arming as per ELRS convention.  
    AUX2 for profile switching. ⚠ Mind the profile assignments, ensure proper AUX2 mapping ⚠ 
    Profile #1 at -100% for 1400RPM  
    Profile #2 at -33% for 1850RPM  
    Profile #3 at +33% for 2100RPM  
    Profile #4 at +100% for Autorotation with bailout.  
    AUX3 controls PWM output on the SBUS port, for disabling a backup capacitor.  

    Enjoy!
